    "description": "The metahook is a key component of the Goblin’s recursive processing weave, allowing it to generate and output massive amounts of weaponized code. These broadcasts can be “sharpened” or “softened” in response to directives from a pilot or an INSTINCT system. To “soften” code, the metahook dips into its pilot’s subjectivity and blankets an ally in wave after wave of empathetic shielding. This spreading of melded code and qualia acts as a powerful shielding agent against systemic attacks; however, feedback is common and dangerous to both parties.",
