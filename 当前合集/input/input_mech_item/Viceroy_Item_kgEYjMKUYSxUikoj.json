Weathering the onslaught thanks to its blast-resistant exterior, the Viceroy can utilize this salvo, when coupled with the miniaturized Tengu one-burst jump system, for a variety of advanced battlefield tactics. This allows it to either deliver a near-unstoppable alpha strike or make a dramatic exit. “Heaven’s downpour” is a technique that strikes fear in any that face a Viceroy pilot in combat.",

    "description": "An offshoot from SSC’s Bella Ciao line, the Viceroy is the result of rigorous field-testing in pursuit of a more accessible version of its larger sibling, the ever-ubiquitous Monarch. Originally developed under the moniker “MicroMonarch”, the scaled-down frame is nevertheless a force to be reckoned with and sports the high-quality engineering expected from all SSC mechs. Where the Monarch focuses on devastating long-range firepower, the Viceroy is more akin to a close-range brawler, using its sophisticated near-threat targeting arrays to wield the launchers of its sibling with deadly precision. <br />Equipped with a scaled-down version of the Monarch’s own SSC-30 High-Penetration Missile System, the Viceroy is more than capable of saturating an area around itself with relatively small but high-yield warheads, aimed with pinpoint accuracy. <br />This, coupled with an integrated, one-use burst jump pack, turns the Viceroy into a potent shock trooper with devastating first-strike capabilities. This role is supported by its ability to shrug off any potential self-inflicted harm from any “shock and awe” maneuvers thanks to its advanced blast-resistant armor plating. <br />Since its recent official release, the Viceroy has become – by SSC standards – an affordable frame that is now being widely rolled out to various SSC associates and subsidiaries. Slated to be approved for mass production, it is anticipated the Viceroy will become a frontline “soldier” mech to ultimately rival the likes of Harrison Armory’s Sherman.",
