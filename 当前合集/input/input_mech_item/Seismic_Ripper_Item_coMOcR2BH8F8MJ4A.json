    "description": "A deadly weapon created from simple shaped charges – the perfect catalyst for insurrection. Easily obtained and disguised as necessary equipment for blast-mining, charges rigged to produce a linear seismic pulse were common in the early days of Ungrateful activity. As Baronic security adapted their strategies, so too did the Ungratefuls; now, these once-simple explosive devices are much more complex – harder to detect, and far more deadly.",
