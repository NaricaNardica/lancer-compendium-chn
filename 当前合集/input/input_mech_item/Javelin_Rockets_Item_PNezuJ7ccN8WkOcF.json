You fire a volley of auto-targeting rockets into the air: until the start of your next turn, when a character moves into or passes above a chosen space – no more than 10 spaces up – they are hit by a rocket, taking 3 kinetic damage. Each space can be triggered once and then the effect disappears on that space.",
