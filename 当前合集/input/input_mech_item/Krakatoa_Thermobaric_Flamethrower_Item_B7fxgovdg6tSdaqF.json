        "description": "Between the thick arboreal environment of Hercynia, the swarm tactics of the Egregorians, and the ineffectual performance of slug ammunition, the need for wide-effect weapons was apparent. GMS quick developed the Krakatoa – a thermobaric flamethrower – and disseminated it to affiliates. The Krakatoa was quickly adopted by Union’s Marine Expeditionary Forces, seeing heavy use in the depths of the Hercynian continental jungles thanks to its stability, reliability, and stopping power.<br>Later reworked and adopted by the Armory following the resolution of the Hercynian Crisis, the Krakatoa has become a popular tool for the creation of area-of-denial firebreaks.",
