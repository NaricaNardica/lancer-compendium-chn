    "description": "The Orchis is the spear and shield of the house companies and makes up the bulk of the fighting forces in Baronic space. Its ubiquity does not bely its reliability and durability, nor its iconic status as the line mech of the baronies. Due to a trade negotiation with Smith-Shimano corpro, the Orchis is compatible with the Black Witch licensing scheme and can appropriate the majority of its gear and weaponry. Utilizing ancient and sturdy mag-lock technology, the Orchis wields a heavy Scuta shield, reinforced to deflect incoming fire. This shield can be locked in place and braced against another shield of its own kind, creating a tessellated wall of impenetrable strength. The half-mile long shield walls of the throne guard, blazoned with their house emblems, are an iconic and terrifying sight in Baronic history. The kuirassers of the Baronies decorate their Orchii with house heraldry, war banners, and trophies of past conflicts, each one the avatar resplendent with the regalia of a decorated warrior.",
