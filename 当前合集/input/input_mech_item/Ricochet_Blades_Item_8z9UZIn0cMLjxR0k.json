    "description": "These disc-shaped blades are designed, produced, and hand-finished by SSC’s Toledo blade enclave. The material is flexible enough to bounce when striking against surfaces but sharp enough to slice bone and metal. Unlike the edged weapons made by the more restrictive Terashima enclave, the Toledo enclave produces these weapons with the expectation that they’ll be used and discarded. This does not impact their quality but does lead to supply shortages from time to time – this exclusivity is intentional. Due to their comparative rarity, Toledo discs are often used as currency by Sparri espadas; their use in combat or hunting is a mark of status.",
