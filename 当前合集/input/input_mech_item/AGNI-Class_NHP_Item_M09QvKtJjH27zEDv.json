    "description": "AGNI was developed during the Hercynian Crisis using a combination of combat performance data recorded by extant subsentient artificial intelligences (weapons systems, COMP/CONs, co-pilot systems, tactic-minds, general combat data) and the modeled neural network of an Egregorian overmind captured and vivisected by the Union Science Bureau.<br />AGNI Prime was used to devise systems of heat management that have since been disseminated throughout core space, ensuring unparalleled heat processing, recycling, and shielding. Further developments into radiation shielding, omninet capability, and nanite control are forthcoming; meanwhile, AGNI clones have been optimized to support mech core systems.<br />Pilots report that AGNI clones are generally cold and efficient. An insignificant percentage have reported instances of memory recitation and command rejection, followed days later by total breakdown through attempted self-emancipation. Pilots are recommended to cycle their AGNI clones at least once every six standard months.",
