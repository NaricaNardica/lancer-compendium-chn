    "description": "<p>The ENKIDU can be taken at rank II of the TOKUGAWA license instead of the base FRAME, or retrofitted during Act 1 of the No Room for a Wallflower Campaign.</p><p>This experimental frame was secretly designed as a TBK chassis for lateaction combat in the Hercynian Crisis. Deployed in limited numbers against the remaining Egregorian hives in the brutal last stages of the war, the Enkidu’s neurological interfacing was dangerous: raw and unshielded. The power and aggression flowing through the subroutines that govern the mech bled into its pilot’s subjectivity, making them lose themselves in a storm of violence, constantly pushing themselves to greater and greater acts of destruction. This effect was incredibly hard for pilots to handle – the fallout rate from the program was extremely high, and the survivors required extensive conditioning, implants, and a cocktail of neurological suppressants to continue.</p> <p>The true aim of the Enkidu program was not to fight Egregorians, which were in the final stages of practical extinction, but to use the battlefield as a testing ground for the eventual deployment of the chassis against ThirdComm revolutionaries and dissidents. Though the codebase for the Enkidu was eventually discontinued and molded into what is now the Tokugawa, the difficulties with the initial project prevented it from getting off the ground before the revolution took hold. The remaining prototypes were buried along with the rest of Hercynia’s history.</p>",
