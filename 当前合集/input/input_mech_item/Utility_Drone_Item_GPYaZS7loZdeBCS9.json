Legionnaire doctrine calls for extensive use of Argos drones to supplement and enhance squad performance, with each drone serving as a multipurpose platform incorporating numerous systems and components, including threat interception arrays, electrostatic discharge area denial/suppression projectors, and field diagnostic loadouts.",
