A simple and brutally effective weapon, the shrapnel cannon fires explosive shells lined with a metal/polymer composite that erupts into deadly shards upon detonation. The composite's elasticity is sufficient to enable these shards to ricochet off hard surfaces without compromising terminal ballistics, enabling wide-coverage indirect fire across spaces where traditional CQB weapons can't reach without exposing the operator in turn.",
