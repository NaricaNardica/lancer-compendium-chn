    "description": "The original Genghis frame marked the dawn of the mech age; the Armory’s new line seeks to redefine it. From its roots as a modified GMS hardsuit, the Genghis Mk I became notorious for its use in the Hercynian Crisis – the first-contact war that triggered the violent overthrow of the Second Committee. In the administrative and political chaos that followed the Crisis, Harrison Armory secured the design and adapted it to serve as the basis of its first proprietary mechs, including the Sherman and the Saladin.<br />The new Genghis bears some resemblance to the chassis of Hercynian notoriety, serving in a similar area-denial/soft-target elimination role; The Genghis Mk II has been brought in line with the Third Committee’s Utopian Pillars.",
