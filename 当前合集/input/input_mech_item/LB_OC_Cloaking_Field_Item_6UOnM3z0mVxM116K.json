    "description": "SSCâ€™s mil-spec cloaking field is the result of extensive experimentation in cooling and light-reflecting sciences. Born from a need to reflect harmful radiation away from ships and EVA modules in deep space, the Lightbend/Overcloak (LB/OC) cloaking field is often used by rangers and long-patrol scout pilots to ensure not only radiation protection, but optical concealment as well. The light- and radiation-bending properties of the LB/OC conceals anything inside of its projected bubble from sensor suites and optical spotting.",
