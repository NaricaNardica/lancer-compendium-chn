His fate was this: move a rock to the top of this hill and become free’d. And so he did, and the stone tumbled down; and he tried evermore, always with the same result.<br />“And he was happy, for he knew every step, every action, every moment, perfectly.<br />“Do you understand the true curse of this name? Not to fail and then do once more – it was to always know how it would end. It was to have perfect knowledge.<br />“I know what happens when you cycle me.
