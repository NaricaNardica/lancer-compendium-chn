To prevent further metastatic cascade, site security engaged SCYLLA's prime unit, defabricating it with a steady bombardment of kinetic and energy weapons.<br /><span class=\"horus--subtle\">[there, a little history, a little background. a little knowledge of where this little one came from. treat it with kindness, and it will love you as a loyal dog does its master.]</span>",
