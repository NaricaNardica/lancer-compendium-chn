Through a combination of unfettered omninet access, hyperspectral relays fired out from a Cloudscout TACSIM projector, sub-networked squadmates, and active/hostile intrusion protocols, ATHENA bootstraps a near-flawless reconstruction of the immediate environment around its host core. ATHENA is unparalleled in its processing power, and with this reconstructed environment, it provides trustworthy, accurate advice to pilots in need of strategic counsel.<br />ATHENA clones tend to be patient, cautious, and measured in their relations with their pilots.",
