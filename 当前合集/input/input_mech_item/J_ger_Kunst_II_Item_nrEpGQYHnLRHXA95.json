The winner may then move 3 spaces in any direction, ignoring engagement and not provoking reactions. The loser may immediately take 2 AP kinetic damage to force the contest to be rerolled. This damage cannot be prevented or reduced in any way.<br>If the result is a tie, the contest immediately ends. Otherwise, the contest continues until one character loses without forcing a re-roll or would take structure damage, in which case they immediately lose.",
