Upon installation the apparatus anchors into the spinal cord, lacing machine and biology and allowing the user to relinquish cognitive allotments, related to the maintenance of biological homeostasis. It acts as a twin temporal processor that grants the user the ability to focus excess cognition on a great range of tasks. In recent years SSC has explored the enhancement of kinesthetic awareness, specifically for spaceborne mech pilots.</p>",
