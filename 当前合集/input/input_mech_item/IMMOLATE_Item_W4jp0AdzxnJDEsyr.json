    "description": "The Kobold PG’s code is unique in that it can be injected into existing civilian mining mechs, allowing them to interact with the full suite of largely improvised, adapted weaponry and systems. The process skips printers entirely; however, in avoiding the constraints of Unionmonitored printers, the process also eschews widely accepted safety standards – a common theme among HORUS PGs. With no governors or consistent standards on the operational envelope of the K-PG, some pilots have discovered the terminal limits of their chassis the hard way.",
