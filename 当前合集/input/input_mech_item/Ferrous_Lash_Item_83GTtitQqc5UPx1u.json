    "description": "Initially developed as a nonlethal crowd-suppression device, the Ferrous Lash is a far more complex and dangerous device in the hands of the right pilot. The Lash consists of a series of integrated launchers that detonate payloads of fast-congealing ferrofluids that restrain their targets. Tuned to the correct frequency, these proprietary ferrofluid blends form into rudimentary ambulatory segments, pulling their hosts back towards the one wielding the Lash.",
