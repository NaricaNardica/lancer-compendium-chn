      "description": "SSC's precognitive neural bridging systems are not paracausal as the name might suggest. Using carefully modulated neural stimulation and acceleration, the operator's ability to consciously process and assimilate even subconsciously-derived sensory input is greatly amplified, reducing feedback delay and enhancing reaction time to near-instinctive levels. This then allows users to more accurately predict immediate future occurrences based on comprehensive sensory awareness and intuitive analysis, hence precognition.<br /><br />To further enhance this system's capability, the Amber Phantom marries precognitive bridging with a chorus of predictive modeling and tactical simulation systems to provide the pilot with even more information. The result is the creation of a holistic battlefield timeline continuously extending forward several seconds in advance of realtime, granting users an unparalleled ability to choose the precise, optimal moment to act in all situations, reacting to ongoing events even before they occur.",

If you take your turn at another point in the round, you may still gain this bonus damage, but you take 1d6 heat when doing so.",

    "description": "Created as an advanced strike chassis for SSC's INSIGHT ORDINAL next-generation weapons evaluation program, the Amber Phantom represents the culmination of numerous technologies developed under the BELLA CIAO line into a single hyperspec, high-performance frame. Based primarily upon the Metalmark platform, the Amber Phantom incorporates an advanced neural bridge derived from the Death's Head's precognitive targeting system in conjunction with TACSIM choral processors in order to amplify the pilot's situational awareness to beyond-human levels.<br /><br />The result of this synergy is an uncanny level of mind/machine-integrated performance akin to seeing into the future. Amber Phantom pilots appear to casually sidestep incoming fire, and their attacks are perfectly timed to intersect enemy positions without any wasted movement. This system is not without its drawbacks; extended use of the neural bridge is said to result in feelings of intense déjà vu, temporal dissociation, and dyschronometria, and pilots are strongly advised to maintain regular downtime rotation cycles and centering exercises in order to minimize these risks.<br /><br />Not currently in widespread distribution, the Amber Phantom has seen extensive use among Constellar special forces, and is also available to select SSC clients under a full-disclosure data sharing and promotional rights agreement.",
