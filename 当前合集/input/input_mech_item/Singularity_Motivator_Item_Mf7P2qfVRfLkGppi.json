    "description": "This unique gravitic power plant was first developed by SSC’s Exotic Materials Group for the first-generation Mourning Cloak. For subsequent models, engineers devised a system that allows pilots to – for a moment – open the grav containment system’s aperture, exposing a slice of naked singularity to realspace.<br />A naked singularity is difficult to perceive for both organics and synthetics, being similar to the heart of a black hole. The sudden exposure essentially removes the mech and its pilot from realtime. The user experiences around 10 seconds of subjective time – a brief window, in which they can act independently of local realtime.<br />SSC recommends against abuse of this system, as the effects of long-term exposure to local sidereal time are still unknown.",
