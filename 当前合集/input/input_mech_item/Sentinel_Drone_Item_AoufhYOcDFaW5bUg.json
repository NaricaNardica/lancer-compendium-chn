The precise appearance, manner of locomotion, and means of operation of a given class of sentinel drone may vary, but regardless they conform to one objective portfolio: deny the enemy and protect the master unit.",

Hostile characters within the affected area take 3 kinetic damage from the droneâ€™s automatic fire before making any attack.<br />The sentinel drone can be redeployed to a new location or recalled as a quick action.",
