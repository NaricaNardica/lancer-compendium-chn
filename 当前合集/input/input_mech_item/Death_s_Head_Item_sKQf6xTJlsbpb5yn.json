Using a neural bridge, SSC’s precognitive targeting system allows pilots to learn constantly and unconsciously from data gathered in the field, equipping them to read situations before they develop. Precognition is highly experimental and the precise mechanisms unknown even to the designers, so SSC recommends limited, monitored use of this system.",

Sacrificing raw hull strength for peerless stability and alacrity, the Death’s Head is a maneuverable fire-support platform able to avoid incoming fire while maintaining a near-perfect lock on its targets. Its unique hexapedal form allows for rapid, low-profile movement in all directions.<br />As an aggressive and line-focused chassis, the Death’s Head is one of the most popular models for Union Navy and Union Department of Justice and Human Rights officers. It is a combat chassis through and through; as the Death’s Head is a chassis produced under SSC’s BELLA CIAO line, there is no civilian analog.",
