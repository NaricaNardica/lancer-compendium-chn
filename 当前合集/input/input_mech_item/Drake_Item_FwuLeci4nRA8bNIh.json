    "description": "The Drake, IPS-N’s first foray into military-grade mech design, is the backbone of any proactive trade-security or anti-piracy force. Its massive, simian frame is built around a single-cast bulkhead, sloped and reinforced to handle sustained fire and the vagaries of vessel-proximal hardvac travel. The Drake is an imposing chassis, its frame evoking the might of ancient armored infantry from a time when greater numbers guaranteed victory.<br />The standard fleet license for the IPS-N Drake outfits each chassis with IPS-N’s high-velocity, high–projectile fragment assault cannon for suppressing and overwhelming targets, and a heavy kinetic–ablative shield for defense. Advanced models feature upgraded weapons and armor including the formidable Leviathan Heavy Assault Cannon, a high-rpm anti-materiel weapon.",
