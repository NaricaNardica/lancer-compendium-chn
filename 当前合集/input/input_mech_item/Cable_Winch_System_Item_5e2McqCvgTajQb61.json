Once attached, you and the target may not move more than 5 spaces away from each other. Either character can tow the other, obeying the normal rules for lifting and dragging, and becoming Slowed while doing so.<br>Any character can remove the cables on a hit with a melee attack or Improvised Attack against Evasion 10.<br>These cables can also be used to drag, pull, or otherwise interact with objects and the environment. They are 5 spaces long and can support a combined Size 6 before they break. Characters can use them to climb surfaces, allowing them to climb without a Speed penalty.",
