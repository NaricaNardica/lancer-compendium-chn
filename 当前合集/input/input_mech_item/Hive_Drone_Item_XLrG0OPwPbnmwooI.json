    "description": "It looks, at first, like a roiling cloud of gray fog, churning and fizzing – smoking soda water spilled across concrete. It advances with curious motion, stretching and snapping back. A confusion of snakes, writhing forward with speed that betrays intent.<br />Color flashes across the gray cloud, a swarm-luminescence – the light created by millions of nanites glowing with heat as they consume whatever they cross.<br />This is greywash, and it is never sated.",

    "effect": "This hive drone can be deployed to a free space within Sensors and line of sight, where it releases a burst 2 greywash swarm with the following effects:<ul><li>Allied characters at least partially within the affected area gain soft cover, as does the hive drone.</li><li>Hostile characters take 1 AP kinetic damage when they start their turn in the affected area or enter it for the first time in a round. Damage from areas created by multiple hive drones does not stack.</li></ul>The drone can be deployed to a different space or recalled as a quick action.",
