    "description": "The Deep Well experimental heat-sink system is a part of the Armoryâ€™s VANGUARD line of equipment, available to licensed beta testers. Through a complex, delicate weave of heat exchangers, Deep Well recycles the heat generated by a mech into usable energy. The system works well, but the delicate nature of the exchange renders it highly volatile.",

    "effect": "When you start your turn in the Danger Zone, you gain Resistance to heat for the rest of the turn. This effect persists even if you leave the Danger Zone during your turn.",
