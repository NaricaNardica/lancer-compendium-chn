    "description": "Reinforced grappling cables allow for full movement and utility in ≤1 g environments. Woven from incredibly strong nanocarbon and arachnosynth threading, reinforced grapple line is carried on waist-mounted spools and attached to charge-actuated brachial projectors. Once fired, the grapples penetrate and anchor to the target. Small meltdown charges seeded every thirty meters of cable both allow rapid disengagement and expose a fresh grapple head, ready for immediate use.",
