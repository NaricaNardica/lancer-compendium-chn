This barrier grants hard cover to adjacent characters, and characters that benefit from this cover also gain Resistance to energy.<br>The barrier doesn’t count as an obstruction and has Immunity to all damage. Characters may freely pass through it but not end their turns inside it, and any character that would be involuntarily moved inside the barrier stops moving if they would end their movement inside it. It lasts for the rest of the scene or until you next use this system.",
