Skins, bones, meat, and other trophies from their bodies can create months – or even years, in the case of especially old, grand, or unique beasts – of prosperity for the hunters and their kin. These popular long rifles, refined to SSC standards, are rugged and durable, perfect for dragging down the great creatures and their attendants.",
