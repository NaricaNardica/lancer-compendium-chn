    "description": "<p>A sidegraded cousin of IPS-N’s Lancaster support frame, the Kidd was produced under a joint development contract by IPS-N’s Titan–Enceladus Field Project and Northstar Branch Robotics. The original pattern for the frame was bought off a mining commune that had rigged their support drones in a slapdash but ingenious neural mesh that both hardened them against tech intrusion and increased their operational efficiency many times over. Urban legend was that the original builder of the rig had used his drone team to bury caches of black-market Volador tech in several wandering asteroids, and out of extreme paranoia made his systems almost impossible to crack. To this day Northstar Branch Robotics tries valiantly to squash down persistent rumors that clues to the location of the caches are hidden in the Kidd’s code base.</p> <p>Designed to provide an aggressive, all-theater support solution to rugged field teams in hostile environments, the Kidd mounts a trio of powerful systems to ensure a broad operational envelope. The Jolly Roger semiautonomous personal orbital platform, bundled with every genuine-license Kidd platform establishes theater control in any open or near-surface environment. A squadron of bundled subalterns (along with an onboard maintenance suite) guarantees friendly support in any environment and provides a broad suite of tactical possibility. Finally, Titan–Enceladus’s SMOKESTACK heat sink pylon represents the cutting edge of IPS-N’s thermodynamic axiomatics, allowing users to offset surplus heat via the creation of a pinhole-window into an omega state of absolute zero.</p> <p>The Kidd is a popular chassis in Evergreen where it is employed as a subaltern command platform for civilian and engineering purposes. Its familiar bulk can also regularly be seen accompanying traders on their way to do business with the Gray Towns.</p>",
