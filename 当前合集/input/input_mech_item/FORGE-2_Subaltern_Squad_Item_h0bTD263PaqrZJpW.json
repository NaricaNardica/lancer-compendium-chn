It is canceled if it’s destroyed.</p> <p>The subalterns aren’t treated as separate entities and can’t be targeted. They return to you if the project is destroyed, canceled, or finished, no matter where you are.</p> <p>If you OVERCHARGE to use this system again, it may ignore the 1/round limit, but the second project must be placed adjacent to the first.</p>",
