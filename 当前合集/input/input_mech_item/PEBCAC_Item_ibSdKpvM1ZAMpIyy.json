This cannot be used on Jammed characters.</p> <p>Additionally, roll 1d6 to determine a side effect from the table below. These effects take place immediately and don&rsquo;t count as an action or reaction. Any movement they cause is involuntary.</p> <ol> <li>Your target becomes JAMMED until the end of their next turn.</li> <li>Your target moves up to its SPEED in a direction of the GM&rsquo;s choice.</li> <li>Your target immediately moves up to 3 spaces toward the nearest character (allied or hostile) and performs an IMPROVISED ATTACK against them. If no characters are in range, it only moves.</li> <li>Your target falls PRONE and takes 2 Kinetic Damage.</li> <li>Your target vents 1d6 Heat and deals the amount cooled as energy damage to all adjacent characters.</li> <li>Your target immediately takes the STABILIZE action and can choose what to do.</li> </ol>",
