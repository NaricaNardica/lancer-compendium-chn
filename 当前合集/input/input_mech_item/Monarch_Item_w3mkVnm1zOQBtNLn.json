    "description": "The Monarch is SSC’s groundbreaking lesson in how to design a fast platform for the delivery of missiles and other self-propelled ordnance. Ready to mount ground-to-ground, ground-to-air, ground-to-orbit, and all-theater missiles and guidance systems, the Monarch can be customized for any payload and any target distance.<br />The Monarch’s large size often leads pilots to underestimate its agility. SSC's rigorous design requirement of one designer per 10 Monarch printings is a mark of luxury in Union’s Core world post-scarcity environment. This emphasis on purposeful scarcity is all that prevents the Monarch from achieving total battlefield dominance. The Monarch is commonly deployed in mixed line and fire-support roles, though field tests of a less resource-taxing MicroMonarch mid- to close-range model is underway. The Monarch is part of SSC’s BELLA CIAO line of combat chassis.",
