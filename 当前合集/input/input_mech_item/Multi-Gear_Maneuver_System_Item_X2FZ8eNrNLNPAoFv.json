Both ends must be attached to a surface, such as a wall or floor. It activates at the end of your turn with the following benefits: <ul> <li>Size 1/2 characters that are adjacent to either end of the line can move to the other end as a quick action as long as they are able to grab onto it. They can hop off at any point along the line if they wish. </li> <li>Whenever Size 1 or larger characters cross the space occupied by the line for the first time in a round or start their turn within one, they must succeed on an Agility save or fall Prone. </li> </ul>Any character adjacent to the start or endpoint of the line can tear the line down by succeeding on a Hull check as a quick action or by successfully performing a melee attack against either end. The line has 1 HP and Evasion 10. Destroying the zip line in this way does not destroy this system. Otherwise, the line lasts until you use this system again.",
