Utilizing a tiered hierarchy/command structure allowing them to operate at levels ranging from individual fire teams to brigade strength under local comp/con or NHP command, a squadron of PRAETORIAN subalterns can also be seconded to pilots under local nexus node control, and one or more squadrons are often assigned to legionnaire units during combat operations to provide integrated support.",
