    "description": "The IPS-N Kidd’s SMOKESTACK Heat Sink represents the latest in IPS-N’s heat dispersion systems for chassis and other CORE-powered vehicles and vessels. Utilizing proprietary axiomatics, the SMOKESTACK system establishes (via deployable pylon) a localized, minor, and stable pinhole into an omega state, allowing users to – for a certain value of thermodynamic exchange – cool excess heat debt by depositing it into that same state. Once the SMOKESTACK reaches capacity – a hard-coded feature – it detonates, making the system just as effective a weapon as it is a heat sink.",
