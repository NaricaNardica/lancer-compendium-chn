      "description": "IPS-N security teams are no strangers to the dangers of ship-to-ship or ship-to-station boarding actions. Tight corridors, unstable gravity, dark environments, hard vacuum, and the potential dual threat of both organic and inorganic opposition make boarding actions some of the most statistically deadly engagement – according to IPS-N’s internal metrics, even the winning side should expect at least 30% casualties. Hoping to lessen the cognitive burden on pilots and any NHPs or COMP/CONs installed in their chassis, IPS-N developed the WATCHDOG co-pilot. The WATCHDOG is a simple subsentient partition: a flash-homunculus of aggregated intelligence generated from thousands of after-action reports from boarding actions, debriefings, and volunteer donors. Not an NHP, nor even a COMP/CON, the WATCHDOG is a robust tactical program similar to a smart weapon. That said, its ability to operate without cycling presents certain advantages: namely, these co-pilots have some capacity to learn and make best-guess predictions based on analysis of their pilots. WATCHDOGs tend to have plain personalities – to whatever extend they can be said to have one – and are a favorite of pilots looking for a no-nonsense attitude and crisp, efficient counsel.<br />The WATCHDOG system is currently under review by a joint USB/UDoJ-HR commission, but there has been no formal stay on production yet issued.",

    "description": "The Tortuga is IPS-N’s short-to-medium range line of mechs. Conceived, tested, and perfected in the void of deep space, the Tortuga was made to breach and clear carrier decks, hostile station environments, and the spinal columns of capital ships. It excels at occupying space and filling hallways with its angular bulk, often acting as a walking battering ram by boarding parties and marines. But the Tortuga defends just as effectively as it attacks, using its broad plates of brachial armor to shield itself and any advancing allies.",
