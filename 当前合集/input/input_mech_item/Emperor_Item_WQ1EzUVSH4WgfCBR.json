    "description": "<p>“In Exotic Materials we don’t have problems: we have doors that are not yet open to us. A ‘problem’ presents endless branching paths. Doors are binary. Open and shut. ‘The tyranny of the problem lies in the impossible breadth of possibility.’ Smith said that. He went on to say that this is a useless framing for tinkerers and hobbyists whose ethics are defined by calcified, hand-wringing institutions. So! EXMAT is solutions-focused: there is no such thing as a problem, only a door, and the question: can we open it, or do we have to bash it down?</p> <p>Progress. Smith Shimano has always been about progress. Humanity has always been about progress. In service of progress, one must accept the necessity of teleological suspension.</p> <p>For the Emperor, after Hercynia, we had to bash the door down. Ugly process, but the riches beyond the door were more than worth it. Syncretic subjectivities, induced gestalt manifestation, H-NHP ontologic bridging, superpositional defensive lensing – look at what the battering ram gave us and tell me you’d rather puzzle out a problem then bash down the door and grab all the gold.</p> <p>What else is there to say? Long live the Emperor, for in its creation did we find the method by which to fling open every locked door. Wondrous things are coming. I’m glad that they’ll be under our control.”</p> <p>– Memo to personal records, Bala Shimano, CEO-1, Exotic Materials Group</p>",
