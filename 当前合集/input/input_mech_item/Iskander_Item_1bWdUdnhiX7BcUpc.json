      "description": "The Broad-Sweep Seeder is a proprietary device developed during the Orrugi Occupation, during which Armory legionnaires fought an embittered, recalcitrant local guerilla movement. IEDs, VBEDs, and D/SABEDs were often employed by the resistance; to counter the threat, Harrison Armory developed the Seeder to simultaneously scan, identify, and eliminate explosive threats in proximity to stationary units. The technology proved successful and, with minor adaptation, was adapted for installation on Armory frames.<br />The Broad-Sweep Seeder emits an excited LIDAR hivecone to flag potential targets: if positive identification occurs, the target is neutralized with a spray of mag-accelerated, dull-coat flechettes. The Seeder can also carry explosive hivemines.",

The Iskander platform has no civilian counterpart: it is intended to be used as a frontline command and control platform, with an emphasis toward identifying and eliminating static explosive threats.",
