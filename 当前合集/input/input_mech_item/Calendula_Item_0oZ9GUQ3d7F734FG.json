Oddly, it is unclear from temporal markers whether the codebase used to create the Calendula was created separately, before contact with Union, despite being nearly identical to the Minotaur codebase.<br />The Calendula uses the internal spatial manipulation abilities of the Minotaur and inverts them, allowing experienced pilots of the mech to cut into a ‘non-space’ widely regarded by Union theorists to be the Aunic Firmament. In this grey and bleak interstitial zone, matter appears as a flowing fog, and is just as easily parted.",
