Each of their Swallowtails is an ingenious, fast-moving suite of meshed software and gear, uniquely tweaked by generations of hardened warriors – imperfect in a way that would make any SSC smith shiver. Each wears its own unique name, has its own unique ballad, and is recorded in the osteomemetics of its home city.",

    "description": "<p>This variant can be taken at rank II of the SWALLOWTAIL license instead of the base FRAME, or gained as EXOTIC GEAR by aiding Dthall Ordo during the campaign.</p><p>This Swallowtail variant is common among HUC ranger forces. It was adopted and reverse-engineered from the material remains of early, abandoned SSC survey expeditions. With no ability to print-replicate the mech, the rangers painstakingly manufactured and assembled each unit to high specifications. Unlike the sleek luxury of other SSC frames, this Swallowtail is a rugged affair. Each one has a suite of marks left by its previous owners – livery, battle paint, custom gear, camouflage, and weathering. They have been repaired and maintained for two generations and each one is precious to the United Cities.</p>",
