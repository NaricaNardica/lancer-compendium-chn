    "description": "Repurposed from polycrete foundry tongs, these simple manipulators are incredibly resistant to heat and deformation. Using the KOBOLD protocols, previously inert forge clamps become the adherent surfaces for thin plasma sheaths; like blades, they can shear through armor, earth, or bulkhead with ease. One common tactic involves “flashing” plasma across the clamps, fusing them to their target until the Kobold pilot “flashes” them free.",
