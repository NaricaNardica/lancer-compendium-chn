From those lessons came visceral terror, perfected. Long-leash technology allows greywash swarms to operate persistently apart from their hives and draw power from alternate sources while remaining under failsafe control of their operator.</p><p>This level of operational safety comes as little comfort to the victims of MYRIOS swarms, however, as the swarms specialize in eating away at their targets in hideous acts of consumption barely tempered by their controllers’ instructions.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Officially, the Hecatoncheires does not exist. Baronic Intelligence denies the domestication of liturgicode seeds recovered from the Blanca Desert after the Maw’s defeat on Khayradin, and instead the Hecatoncheires is described as a local variant HORUS pattern group. The chassis is most frequently encountered in the hands of Company Centimane, whose status as a Free Company (and the occasional appearance of the pattern group elsewhere) lends a thin veneer of plausibility to the official story.</p><p>On Free Sanjak, the Hecatoncheires is a weapon of terror, a nightmare given form from haze and smoke. Revolutionary fire-teams have been known to trek through tropical jungles and the monsoon rains for days, losing members one by one as they are stalked by something just out of sight. Beneath the waters of Ludra’s beach paradises, it is said a monster lurks – tearing apart coastal communities and ships alike. In the deep tunnels, apocryphal tales persist of a thick gray cloud that sweeps through and leaves nothing but dust in its wake.</p><p>Meanwhile, a deep cover DoJ/HR operation working with support from the House of Dust has been trying to unearth solid evidence directly tying the Hecatoncheires to Baronic authorities – a link that might be leveraged to rally the Republican cause and finally ease pressure on Sanjak.</p>",
