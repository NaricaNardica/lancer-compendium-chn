        "description": "The GMS MC-AR assault rifle currently in use throughout Unionâ€™s forces and beyond is a time-tested and reliable design. Rather than attempting to replace it outright, CentComm's Defense Logistics Committee has put out a call for a supplementary standardized battle rifle system that can operate alongside the MC-AR in mixed fireteams, or as a primary weapon system for engaging heavily armored opposition at longer ranges than the MC-TR thermal rifle. The XC-BR uses an advanced caseless electrochemical propellant design capable of firing larger-caliber, armor-defeating rounds while minimizing recoil along with an integrated dynamic targeting system, though the weapon is still plagued by intermittent heat issues that can adversely affect performance.</p>",
