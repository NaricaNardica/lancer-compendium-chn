    "description": "The Mourning Cloak is a brand-new model from SSC’s LUX-Iconic line, and the manufacturer’s newest close-quarters combat and melee specialist frame. The Mourning Cloak emphasizes precision melee combat and is commonly outfitted with a complement of shielded microfilament wires designed to act as an anti-armor slashing weapon.<br />Designed by SSC’s Exotic Materials Group based on data from early engagements against the Ascendant Aun in Boundary Garden, the Mourning Cloak combines SSC’s harvested excerpts of DHIYED paracode with adapted Aunic Firmament-manipulation technology. The Mourning Cloak provides a prestigious and tactical option for situations where firearms are impractical and ordnance is unavailable. As part of the LUX-Iconic line, the Mourning Cloak is a popular order in the Baronies and among various high-manna VIP security firms.",
