    "description": "This artifact, recovered following the termination of Beggar One (provisionally designated /obj/00001), displays a number of unusual properties. Though tangible and presumed to be chemically stable, its monocrystalline composition does not correspond to any known element and emits a steady, measurable level of gamma radiation through an unknown process. Deep magnetic resonance scans indicate the presence of significant quantities of compressed data stored within the object, though it shows no signs of self-directed intelligence at any quantifiable level. Its exact purpose, if it has one, has yet to be determined.",
