      "description": "Developed by the Think Tank as a joint venture with IPS-Northstar’s Stellar Engineering Unit, the Tachyon Loop uses a closed-loop system to restrain and manipulate a tachyon lance, accelerating tachyons at faster-than-light speeds around a central buckler. The buckler can be carried by a mech or mounted directly, interceding directional incoming fire. As the tachyons travel faster than light, they are invisible to the naked eye, giving the shield the appearance of a large spoked wheel.",

    "description": "The Saladin is a hardy and efficient platform for full-squad support shielding. Based on early defense-oriented versions of the Genghis, the Saladin became the stuff of Armory legend following the exploits of Harrison I “Fearkiller” during the Interest War.<br />Since its first iteration, the Saladin has proved successful in a defensive and support role; it has even become a mainstay among Union Department of Justic and Human Rights liberator teams engaged in emancipation and refugee escort missions, despite the ideological (and, often, tactical) friction between the Armory and the DoJ/HR. Records from these engagements indicate that the Saladin’s massive bulk alone was a comfort and morale boost to DoJ/HR troopers and their charges, many of whom referred to the mechs as “Big Sal”. Union-flagged Saladin pilots often report null balances on bar tabs following engagements in emancipated systems.",
