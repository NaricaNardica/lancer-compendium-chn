At the start or end of any turn, while a spike grenade is attached, you may detonate all armed spike grenades as a reaction. Characters to whom they are attached take 1d6+3 kinetic damage and are knocked back 3 spaces in a direction of your choice, while objects just take the damage. Characters can detach spike grenades from themselves by passing another Agility save as a quick action on their turn. All grenades detach at the end of the scene.",

    "description": "Originally designed as a load variant for use with the Hammer U-RPL, spike charges carry dozens of hardened flechettes designed to tumble, ricochet, and pierce upon shell detonation, tearing apart flesh and soft targets with sheer torque. As a payload for impact-activated grenades and proximity-activated mine, these devices found their use first in micro/null-grav combat, in which out-ofcontrol vessels and units could themselves be turned into missiles. In gravity-well combat, this system is less deadly but no less chaotic.",
