    "description": "Emergency repair modules are often a mainstay on Armory chassis galaxy-wide. Through a combination of active nanite slurry, hardpatch welding, and shunting to redundant systems in response to immediate damage, they ensure that a chassis will be able to quickly complete nonmassive battlefield repairs in order to remain operational. A number of informal celebratory traditions have arisen throughout the legions to commemorate a pilot's first time taking damage sufficient to trigger an ERM in combat.",
    "destroyed": false,
    "effect": "Whenever you or an adjacent ally Braces, you may expend a charge and spend 1 Repair to restore that character's HP to full immediately after they take damage from the triggering attack. If that character took structure damage from the triggering attack, they also roll one less die on the structure damage check to a minimum of 0 (which results in no effect).",
