      "description": "<p>Initial Taraxacum design drafts called for a highly sensitive, custom-printed sensor suite. Unfortunately, a litany of design flaws forced engineers on Crossland to fit the first prototypes with existing sensor modules meant for high-altitude survey drones.</p><p>Test pilots immediately took a shine to the replacement sensors despite their significant power draw, referring to them as “God’s eyes”. Their ability to resolve terrain through even the thickest vegetation massively simplified wilderness navigation and landing, while tuning them to pick up specific emission bands conferred an obvious combat advantage in high-density environments.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Those who examine the House of Remembrance’s push to colonize its holdings in the Dawnline Shore often highlight the parallels between Crossland’s extensive rainforests and a mythologised Arrudyen past, as well as the political pressure on the Liberal house from its Republican-leaning elements. Less often examined is the pervasive cultural impact of the industry that has been built – almost from scratch – to support the house’s colonial goals.</p><p>The Taraxacum has become almost synonymous in popular omnivids with the pioneer spirit of the colonial effort. The image of a heavy mech effortlessly lifting gear, vehicles, industrial equipment, and even prefabricated building components into and above the thick canopies is a symbol of Arrudyen power in distant lands. Moreover, the Taraxacum is a capable military frame prized by Karrakin commanders across the Dawnline Shore both as a mobility multiplier, and for its performance as an airborne early warning and surveillance platform in support of ground operations.</p>",
