Characters partially within the affected area ignore this effect and draw line of sight as usual.<br>Characters can pass through the shield, but when crossing the perimeter for the first time in a round or starting their turn overlapping the boundary, they take 2 Burn.<br>This shield lasts for the rest of the scene, or until deactivated as a protocol.",

    "description": "The Hardlight Defense System is an imperfect implementation of theoretically perfect technology. Currently in development by Think Tank NHPs and engineers, hardlight devices project tight, stable waves of light – akin to lasers – that repel matter and energy. In effect, this creates a solid surface, useful for shielding or temporary barrier construction; however, current technology is unable to lower the ambient temperature enough to prevent these surfaces from burning organic matter.",
