    "description": "<p>A proof of concept more than a line-production chassis, there have been select releases of White Witch licenses by Smith-Shimano’s LUX-Exotic group to elite military enclaves, most notably to the upper cadres of the House of Moments.</p> <p>The White Witch builds on the platform established by the Black Witch; utilizing SSC’s signature magtech weapons and equipment, it takes Black Witch and tunes it for hypersolipsistic focus, narrowing the effect cone to encompass only the White Witch and its pilot.</p> <p>The White Witch marks SSC’s first foray into null-ordnance/environmental-manipulation chassis. When active, its entire chassis becomes a conduit for onboard base-compound magtech agitators to exploit its immediate environment, drawing atomic components out of organic and inorganic objects and surfaces to enhance its built-in defensive systems. The White Witch reorganizes these molecular draws using its chassis as substrate, quickly forming substantive defenses and weapons from “thin air”.</p> <p>This process has understandably traumatic effects on organic and inorganic materials inside the immediate effect cone. </p>",
