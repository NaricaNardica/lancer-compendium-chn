    "flavor": "The reason some pilots haven’t seen a Sniper on the battlefield is that those pilots are dead. These mechs are built for stability, targeting, and extremely long-range  kinetic damage weapons at the cost of mobility, and they tend to operate in small, self-sufficient teams far removed from direct combat. Sniper pilots are a proud breed, emphasizing economy and elegance over destructive power.",
    "tactics": "Rightly feared, Snipers are devastating when it comes to dealing focused damage. Using Sniper’s Mark, they can deal direct structure damage, making short work of almost any character. Opponents can avoid this with clever use of cover, or by dropping Prone. Snipers’ main downside is that they need to be fairly stationary to do their best work, as their rifle requires a full action to fire.",
