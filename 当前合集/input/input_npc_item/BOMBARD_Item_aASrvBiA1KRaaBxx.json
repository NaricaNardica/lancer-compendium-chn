    "flavor": "Alta All-Theater Ballistics’ archetypal Bombard chassis and their licensed facsimiles are a common sight in flashpoints across the galaxy. Built for staying power across long-uptime deployments, Bombard-type mechs are an accessible solution for armed forces looking to quickly deploy artillery to a theater. Chassis configured to the parameters of this class are usually positioned in fortified positions miles behind the line; one especially asymmetrical deployment strategy involves placing Bombard batteries above the theater of operations – typically on a local moon, locked-orbit natural satellite, or on a purpose-built orbital platform. From their vantage point, the battery can then rain shells down upon the world below, far removed from the dangers of combat.",
    "tactics": "Bombards are very long-range artillery mechs designed to punish characters that stay close together to take advantage of adjacency bonuses. They are relatively fragile up close, but resilient at a distance, so place them far back to maximize their effectiveness. Bombards’ Earthshaker Shells are great for preventing enemy movement and providing cover, but can harm allies as well.",
