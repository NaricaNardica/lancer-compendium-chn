    "flavor": "Aegis-archetype mechs are built to hold ground, support their allies, and suppress enemies. First used to great effect during the Comorrand Action by a Karrakin pilot, Lady Gloria of House MacLennan, Aegisâ€™s are known for their powerful defensive measures. Their pilots can expertly make a bulwark out of the smallest barricade with anything from conventional tools to cutting-edge technologies.",
    "tactics": "Aegises are tough and defensive support units. They are most effective when positioned so that their Defense Net can cover as many allies as possible since they can be difficult to redeploy. Regenerative Shielding also protects the Aegis from mobility-reducing effects.",
