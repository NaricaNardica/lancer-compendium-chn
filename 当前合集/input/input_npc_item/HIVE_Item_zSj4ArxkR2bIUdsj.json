    "flavor": "In theory, drones and drone swarms developed after the Deimos Event are not too different from their older cousins: they establish a local omninetwork; fabricate and deploy a century or half-century of drones; and then coordinate them to achieve their objectives. Still, the complex handlerâ€“trainer relationships that allow pilots to segue between direct control and autonomous operation cause psychological trauma after a month of continuous drone operation. It is recommended that they cycle their paired hive nexus every two weeks.",
    "tactics": "Hives use Razor Swarm to control the battlefield, granting soft cover to their allies and denying areas to their enemies. Deploy swarms and use Drone Barrage to lock down enemies, or move them into the range of swarms and allies.",
