    "flavor": "Mirage-class mechs are often found in the employ of HORIZON-aligned militant groups. With no originating manufacturer, they are one of the few open-source non-HORUS pattern groups available to cells that know where to look. Mirages deploy advanced liturgicode to wrap themselves and their allies in veils of illusion and misdirection. While it’s clear that the warping effects that surround these mechs are caused by sensor distortion, they are powerful enough to affect even organic systems – exercise caution when engaging.",
    "tactics": "Mirages are potent support mechs, able to teleport their allies around at will and shut down ranged attackers with Warp Sensors. They can make allied characters Invisible, but become vulnerable while doing so. These strengths come at a price: weapons and systems that ignore cover – such as Seeking weapons – can get around Warp Sensors, and Mirages don’t deal any damage on their own.",
