    "flavor": "SatriaBarong’s Espada range of half-frame mechs has long been a popular choice in the chassis racing circuit; notably, Espadas are the mechs of choice for the vaunted SatriaBarong–ShimanoLUX chassis racing team. Recently, SatriaBarong – with the blessing of SSC – has moved to create a mil-spec, de-licensed variant of the Espada without the ShimanoLUX branding, giving rise to the Hornet archetype, a platform open for other companies to adapt and improve. The most notable of these competitors is Chandrasekhar &amp; Herschel, the primary sponsor of the new Blueshift Grand Prix racing circuit.",
    "tactics": "Hornets are small, fast controllers that are extremely hard to hit and incredibly annoying. They deal limited damage, but their ability to inflict mobility-reducing conditions is great for locking down enemy strikers. Fortunately for their enemies, Hornets have a low E-Defense that makes them vulnerable to smart weaponry and tech attacks.",
