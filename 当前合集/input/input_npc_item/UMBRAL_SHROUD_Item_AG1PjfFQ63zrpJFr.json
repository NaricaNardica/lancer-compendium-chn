    "effect": "At the start of any combat, when they arrive as reinforcements, or 1/round as a protocol, the Lurker can create a rippling storm of nanites – a SHROUD ZONE – in a free Blast 1 area within Range 5. <br />SHROUD ZONES provide soft cover. Additionally, while inside a SHROUD ZONE:<ul><li>Lurkers (including this one) become INVISIBLE and gain RESISTANCE to all damage and heat.</li><li>Hostile characters are SHREDDED and IMPAIRED.</li></ul><br />Shroud Zones can only be targeted by tech attacks and weapons that target E-DEFENSE (e.g., smart weapons). They have E-DEFENSE {10/13/16} and disperse upon any successful attack.<br />The Lurker can have no more than three SHROUD ZONES active at the same time. SHROUD ZONES can overlap each other, but their effects do not stack.",
