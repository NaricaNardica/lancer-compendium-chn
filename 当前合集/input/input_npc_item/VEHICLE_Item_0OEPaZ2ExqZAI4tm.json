    "description": "Despite the prevalence of mechs, the majority of armored combat, transport, scouting, and myriad other civilian and military tasks falls to the humble tracked or wheeled vehicle. Powered by fusion, internal combustion, electricity, hydrogen, wind, people, paracausal engines, or something even more unusual, vehicles can carry people, mount weapons, be girded in armor, or otherwise accomplish quickly the simple tasks for which they were designed: moving people and things quickly and in good condition from point A to point B.<br />This template can be applied to any Mech NPC. They lose the Mech tag and become a Vehicle instead.",
