Attacks and effects that trace a line directly to this facing treat the MBT as though it has 6 Armor and Resistance to damage from Blast, Burst, Line, and Cone attacks and effects. AP damage, burn, and any damage taken by the MBT while it is Shredded is still reduced by 2 when coming from attacks and effects made against this facing. Mines and other proximity-based systems ignore this trait. Whenever the MBT makes a standard move or Boost, it can change which side its armored facing is on.",
