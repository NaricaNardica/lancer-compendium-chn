    "flavor": "The tank remains a core component of modern military doctrine even in the era of combat chassis, with a history stretching back to the earliest days of pre-Fall armored warfare. Despite the many technological advances since then, the overall design of modern main battle tanks remains immediately recognizable; an armored vehicle housing a large, turreted primary weapon supplemented by secondary armaments, blending firepower, protective countermeasures, and mobility into a multipurpose unit capable of offensive or defensive maneuvers as necessary. While chassis tend to be much more flexible and configurable strike platforms, tanks make up for this with the ability to more easily mount heavier armor without compromising their ability to employ large- caliber weaponry while on the move. The sheer variety of tank configurations which can be found throughout the galaxy is perhaps more numerous than even chassis variants, with different nations, militaries, and even private companies all favoring designs that best suit their preferred combat doctrines.",
    "tactics": "The MBT is a heavily armored and heavily armed \"setpiece\" unit that can quickly overwhelm enemies with both their speed and firepower. Barraging with both its main gun and secondary weapon along with the option of using Tank Shock to run other characters over allows it to quickly deal a tremendous amount of damage, and Composite Armor makes it incredibly resilient, but it has to balance this with both the restrictions to its movement and its visible armored facing which makes it vulnerable to being flanked. Choosing when to fire from range and when to press the attack are key to getting the most out of this unit.",
