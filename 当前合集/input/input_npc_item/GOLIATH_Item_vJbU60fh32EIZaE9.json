    "flavor": "Along the Sierra Madre Line – the eighth ring of territory out from Cradle – the Dangun frame is a familiar sight. Manufactured by Park Armored Systems and popularized by the Dagger Squadron mercenary company, the Dangun is popular for its toughness, kinetic damage-trade ability, and reliable all-theater performance. The Dangun is a mech to build strike forces around – a Goliath-class frame capable of mounting powerful magtech, with a design that’s tough to counter in kinetic damage combat.<br />With a number of small fleet contracts in its portfolio, Park Armored Systems is a manufacturer worth keeping an eye on; indeed, Harrison Armory has taken particular notice, and omninet rumors suggest a possible partnership in the near future.",
    "tactics": "Goliaths are relatively mobile defenders that can bring enemies to them. With Crush Targeting, Goliaths force dangerous enemies to focus attacks on them; all it needs is line of sight, allowing Goliaths to target even fast or hard-to-hit characters. The prodigious size of Goliaths also lets them provide cover for their allies.",
