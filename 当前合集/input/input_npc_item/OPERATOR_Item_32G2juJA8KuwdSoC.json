    "flavor": "Operators are known-unknowns, rarely encountered on the front lines, but this should not be mistaken for fragility. Operators are dangerous and deadly in every way. Like their mechs, Operators’ bodies are loaded with the most advanced tech available. When they die in combat, it’s not unknown for their bodies – and their mechs — to self-immolate, rendering any technology and data into ash.",
    "tactics": "Operators are elite and extremely mobile artillery mechs. They aren’t particularly hardy, but can use Trace Drive to teleport around the battlefield and put themselves in advantageous positions: on top of obstructions or terrain, or in cover – anywhere they can snipe at enemies with their highly accurate Raptor Plasma Rifles.",
