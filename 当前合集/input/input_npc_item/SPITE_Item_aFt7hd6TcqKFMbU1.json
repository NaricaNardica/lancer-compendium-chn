    "flavor": "The Spite is an aggressive tech defender chassis commonly used by HORUS techno cults, pirates, and insurgent factions. By using a reactor-override liturgicode, these mechs are able to pry a mech’s reactor cores open and keep them that way, spiking them with feedback each time a weapon is fired. Unaware or reckless pilots taking the field against an experienced Spite pilot will often find themselves cooking themselves to death.",
    "tactics": "The Spite punishes characters who rely on heat management or careful heat generation to maximize their damage output. Use IMPRISON to lock down dangerous damage-dealers and ENTHRONE it somewhere it can guard its allies, but be careful – it’s relatively immobile and can’t do much on its own.",
