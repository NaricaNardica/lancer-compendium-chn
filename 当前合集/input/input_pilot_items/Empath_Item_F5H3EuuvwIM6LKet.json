You can perceive it best at night, when it’s quiet: your name, or a whisper that speaks something deeper and more true, spoken in the voice of another. You don’t feel any fear when you hear it. You feel complete. It takes some time down the well, but one morning you awake resolute.</i></p><p><i>Time to find the distant speaker.</i></p><p>Whether your character was born offworld and came to Hercynia knowing nothing of the Egregorians, Witness, or any of the planet’s history, or you were born in Evergreen or one of the cities of the HUC, your character can be an empath. An empath is someone who can not only register when Witness is being shared, but begin to understand it and, with some training, even add their own subjectivity to it.</p><p>Mere exposure to Hercynia is enough for a character to become an empath. Nobody is “born” an empath – it is a learned process, not an inherited one. Although, like all skills, some people find it easier than others, anyone can potentially learn to understand Witness. Normally, human empaths bond with Egregorians – there are many examples of such in the United Cities. Rarely, empaths can form bonds with other humans – a process that is as rare and wondrous to Egregorians as it is to the humans undergoing it, and one that also suggests that a human extension of Witness may latent and possible with exploration.</p>",
