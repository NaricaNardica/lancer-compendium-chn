Now, as a pilot, she dives headfirst into the hardcode of any mech core she come across. Firewalls, gatekeeper protocols, invasion, defense – nothing stands in her way. Han wins fights without firing a single shot; if her enemy can’t control their own mech, then they can’t do anything to stop her.",
