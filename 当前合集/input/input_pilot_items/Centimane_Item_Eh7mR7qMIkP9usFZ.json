    "description": "In the aftermath of the attack on Tartarus Bay, an anonymous source identified agents of the Karrakin Royal Intelligence Service as the culprits. The Baronies quickly released a statement of denial, which was never countered with hard evidence. Rumors of raw footage from the attack were unsubstantiated. Public reaction – anger, terror – to the station’s destruction quieted. The corpse of Tartarus Bay was shunted away from its stable orbit, directed toward the nearest star.<br />A month later, Baronies-local omninet was flooded with previously suppressed footage from the attack on the station, confirming the rumors: Baronic agents did release the greywash swarm into Tartarus Bay. Further data dumps by Ungrateful agents indicated the existence of a secret Baronic intelligence outfit: the Centimane – the Hundred Hands.",
