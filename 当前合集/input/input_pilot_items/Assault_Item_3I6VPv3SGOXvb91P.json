    "detail": "Take part in direct and overt combat: fighting your way through a building packed with hostile mercenaries, trading shots between rain-slick trenches, fighting in chaotic microgravity as part of a boarding action, or engaging the enemy in the smoking urban rubble of a city under orbital bombardment — When you assault, you’re always assaulting something (a position, a rival pilot, an enemy force, a group of guards), and it’s always loud, open, direct action."
