    "detail": "Kill or disable someone quickly and quietly, from up close and personal or from a distance, probably before they even notice. This is probably a single person but could be two people relatively close together (any more is sort of stretching it and definitely risky). If youâ€™re looking down a sniper scope at a target, preparing to nerve pinch a guard to knock them out instantly, quick-drawing during a gun duel, or dropping from a ceiling to slit a throat, this is the action to use."
