    "description": "HUC rations rely heavily on fish, either smoked or tinned in spiced oil; dried mushrooms which can be reconstituted with water; sealed packs of flatbread or crackers; pickled macroalgae; dried fruits; rice; oats; and tea and freeze-dried coffee. In some ways, these rations are familiar to anyone who's ever subsisted on military fare. In others, they're a reminder of just how far from home you are.",
