    "description": "Behind the line, Mike Manfrin doesn’t have much to do but wait and make ready. He keeps clean the cannons; makes ordered rows of his shot and shell. He packs sandbags onto earthen berms and stitches closed tears in the sheaths over his chassis’ joints.<br />In an instant, everything changes. Chatter over the local omni. The percussive throb of the medivac lifting off from the other side of the base. Somewhere, a firefight. This is his entrance music, his call to join the fight: a desperate cry for help from a distant friend as the enemy draws close. Time to get to work.<br />His arrival is known by the flight of his shells across the sky, the trembling earth, and the dust that once was.",
