    "description": "Adding this much additional power to a weapon’s ammunition is generally not sanctioned, but it is effective. You can spend this reserve to empower your weapons. The next successful ranged or melee attack you make can’t have its damage reduced in any way, and the target must pass a Hull save or be knocked Prone. This effect ends when you hit with a ranged or melee attack roll, or at the end of the scene.",
