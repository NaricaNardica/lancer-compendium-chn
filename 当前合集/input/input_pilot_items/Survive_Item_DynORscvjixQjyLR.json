    "detail": "Persevere through harsh, hostile, or unforgiving environments, such as the vacuum of space, frozen tundra, a pirate enclave, a crime-ridden colony, untamed wilderness, or scorching desert. You most often use survive when you want to take a journey through wilderness environments, navigate, or avoid natural hazards such as carnivorous wildlife, rockfalls, thin ice, or lava fields. Alternately you could use it to avoid man-made hazards, such as navigating a city safely, or avoiding dangerous areas of a space station. You could also use it when testing personal endurance, such as shaking off poison or alcohol."
