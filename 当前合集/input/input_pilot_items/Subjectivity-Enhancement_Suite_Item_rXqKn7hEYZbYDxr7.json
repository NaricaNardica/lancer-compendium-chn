    "description": "A subjectivity-enhancement suite is a set of cybernetic implants allowing users to hack systems without a rig. Users of these suites blend the organic with the synthetic, gaining the ability to extrude implanted universal-plug cables from within their body to make hardline connections with terminals. When plugged in, users can access a comprehensive, fully interactive alternate-reality interface with direct omninet access, making navigating – or hacking – local and networked systems as easy as wishing it so (of course, you must be careful: by opening up your mind to the digital, you may face dangers other, less enhanced people are ignorant of).",
