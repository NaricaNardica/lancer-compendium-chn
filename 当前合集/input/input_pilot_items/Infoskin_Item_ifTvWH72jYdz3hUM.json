    "description": "A reactive, synthetic polymer with advanced qualities, infoskin bonds quickly to real skin and hair. Once applied, it responds to electronic signals delivered by linked software, rapidly changing its color and texture – even contorting and distorting its form – allowing wearers to make minor changes to their appearance. With infoskin, it’s a simple matter to alter facial features, hair color, or makeup patterns.",
