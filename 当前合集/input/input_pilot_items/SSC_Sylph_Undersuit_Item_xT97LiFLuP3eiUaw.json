    "description": "Discovered on Acrimea IV, a biome cultivar world controlled by Smith-Shimano Corpro (SSC), the sylph is an organic lifeform that can seemingly survive in nearly any environment. Using breeding-analogous methods defined by established bioengineering doctrines, SSC developed the sylph undersuit – sterile, living sylphs grown as envelopes and fitted to their owners. The sylph bonds to its wearer, forming a symbiotic relationship: the sylph is sustained by the host’s waste products, in return protecting the host from a range of hostile environmental factors.<br />These semi-biological, skin-tight undersuits can be worn for extended periods. They are translucent, semi-liquid, and able to be stored when not in use, conforming to whatever container they are placed in. They clean the host’s body, aid natural healing processes, and eliminate waste. As desired, segments can become opaque, change color, or take on a new texture. Sylph undersuits can cover the host’s head, sealing against vacuum, providing protection against radiation, and filtering air or liquids, even providing the ability to breathe water for a limited time.",
