    "detail": "Get somewhere without complications and with speed, but not necessarily stealth. Climb, swim, or perform acrobatic maneuvers in an attempt to reach a destination faster than the ‘safe’ way. Fall safely from a great height. Move gracefully in zero-g. Chase or flee, outrun, or out pace a target. Get somewhere faster than anyone else. You can also use this when you want to drive or pilot a vehicle."
