    "description": "Using a captured artillery shell as a chassis-deployed improvised explosive device is incredibly unwise, but it’s probably not the worst decision a pilot’s ever made. Your mech is equipped with a powerful, single-use explosive. 1/mission, you can create a Blast 2 explosion within Range 3 as a quick action. Affected characters must pass an Agility save or take 3d6 explosive damage, or half damage on a success. Objects, cover, and terrain within the area automatically take 30 AP explosive damage. Only one PC can have this reserve at a time; anyone rolling this result again picks another reserve of their choice from this list.",
