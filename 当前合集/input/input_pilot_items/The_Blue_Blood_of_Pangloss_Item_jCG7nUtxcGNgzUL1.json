    "description": "A legendary medicinal liquid created by the Order Xenoglossia. The Blue Blood of Pangloss grants precognitive visions to its users, an ability that Augurs spend a lifetime learning to use to its full potential. Extended use causes sterility, and a strange blue tint to the lips, tongue, and extremities. The Blue Blood of Pangloss is impossible to reproduce without access to specific Begi flora and the secret distillation techniques of the Xenoglossary. Unless a PC has both of these, it can only ever be acquired as a limited-use reserve (at extraordinary cost). Those who steal or abuse the Blue Blood often find themselves the targets of the Stygos Grammaton.",
