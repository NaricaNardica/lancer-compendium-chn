    "description": "A strong base-layer suit that recycles water, generates nutrients, and adapts very rapidly to hostile environs, maintaining a stable condition and extending survivability. Flexsuit wearers can go for roughly a week without eating or drink thanks to the ambrosia paste generated by their suit before its systems are depleted; however, they donâ€™t prevent feelings of hunger. Removing the suit for a day or two is enough to replenish its reserves. Flexsuits also maintain a steady temperature within acceptable parameters.",
