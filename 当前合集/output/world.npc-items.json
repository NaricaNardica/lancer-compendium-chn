Chassis configured to the parameters of this class are usually positioned in fortified positions miles behind the line; one especially asymmetrical deployment strategy involves placing Bombard batteries above the theater of operations – typically on a local moon, locked-orbit natural satellite, or on a purpose-built orbital platform. From their vantage point, the battery can then rain shells down upon the world below, far removed from the dangers of combat.",

While chassis tend to be much more flexible and configurable strike platforms, tanks make up for this with the ability to more easily mount heavier armor without compromising their ability to employ large- caliber weaponry while on the move. The sheer variety of tank configurations which can be found throughout the galaxy is perhaps more numerous than even chassis variants, with different nations, militaries, and even private companies all favoring designs that best suit their preferred combat doctrines.",
