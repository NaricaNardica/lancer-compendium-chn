Unlike many of IPS-N's modern frames, the Caliban was designed from the ground up to be a military machine. </p> <p>The Caliban is IPS-N's solution to the  \"Yemanova \" Problem, more properly known as the Impact-Override Problem. Capital ships, the problem posits, are incredibly expensive, demand a tremendous amount of time for corpros and Diasporan states to produce and maintain, and increasingly outmatched by anti-ship weaponry. In a conventional capital duel, a successful kill means the death of thousands of personnel and the loss of millions of units of manna; this makes many commanders gun-shy, encouraging them to rely on subline vessels and fighters to accomplish battle objectives rather than risk their big ships. This strategy tends to prove just as expensive: instead of one or a handful of large ships being destroyed, signifying the end of a battle, engagements can grind on for weeks as squadrons of smaller ships engage inside the unpredictability gap, inching towards victory. </p> <p>IPS-N was the first to crack the Yemanova Problem. The corpro's designers identified the need for a rapidly deployable, sub-signature, directed weapon. It needed to be well-armed and well-armored, small enough to enter a ship and efficiently neutralize personnel in order to achieve victory. IPS-N created the Caliban to solve this need. </p> <p>Cultural critics argue that mechanized chassis venerate the form of a particular humanity; it is an unconscious nod towards the anthrochauvinist roots of the machine among leading designers and fabricators. The Caliban is not that. It was never intended to be an image of man writ large, striding across the battlefield heroically to affect a greater purpose. </p> <p>Unlike many IPS-N frames, the Caliban has no roots in early attempts at self-defense by freighter crews and asteroid miners. It was not born from ingenuity - there is no legacy of resilience, heroism, or the frontier spirit to paper over the purpose of its birth. It has no civilian applications in aid, disaster relief, construction, or farming; it does not build, defend, or inspire – it was designed to solve a numbers problem on a ledger. </p> <p>It is a tool designed to kill human beings very, very quickly. </p>"

Hell - fire - dark ash and staring back at him was not his eyes, but the eyes of the damned and desolate clasped in the hand of Iku.</p><p>As the waters danced in rhythm, Ololade remained fixated. His thoughts wondering why Lake Empakaai- a place renowned for its untenable beauty, would show him a tragedy so visceral. In his reflection he saw thousands plummet from the gaps in Iku’s hand- falling to the pit of Klunga where they’d only be welcomed by death and soot. A portrayal in contradiction within the soothing and pristine waters stretching out to the extents of Ololade’s vision. Rumor would tell that, when he did come down from the tallest of mountains he would scream the words “I am thinking now!” - “ A victory it gave, glorious and valiant”.</p><p>Years later, a painting would circulate throughout the local omninet, affectionately titled- The Descent to Klunga, it was a masterpiece and also a foreshadowing of something that should have only existed in the delirious mind of a lonely SSC citizen and renowned virtuoso.</p><p>Sometime later- another rumor would surface, one that whispered SSC braved Kalunga, stole Iku’s Hand and painted it in fire’s colors and ashe’s hues. They sought to give it a body and called to any who would listen, the first to answer their call was IPS-N. They would offer up a frame, the Blackbeard, in effigy to The Descent to Klunga and from that gift a partnership between SSC and IPS-N would birth the Empakaai.</p><p>The Empakaai is primarily distinguished by its cold core reactor powered and oversized independent comp/con controlled sleeve, Iku’s Hand, that features a 50/50 weight distribution with the rest of the frame. The juxtaposition of SSC elegance and IPS-N artistic sterility have led many to deem the frame a hideous sight.

The power and aggression flowing through the subroutines that govern the mech bled into its pilot’s subjectivity, making them lose themselves in a storm of violence, constantly pushing themselves to greater and greater acts of destruction.

To this day Northstar Branch Robotics tries valiantly to squash down persistent rumors that clues to the location of the caches are hidden in the Kidd’s code base.</p> <p>Designed to provide an aggressive, all-theater support solution to rugged field teams in hostile environments, the Kidd mounts a trio of powerful systems to ensure a broad operational envelope. The Jolly Roger semiautonomous personal orbital platform, bundled with every genuine-license Kidd platform establishes theater control in any open or near-surface environment. A squadron of bundled subalterns (along with an onboard maintenance suite) guarantees friendly support in any environment and provides a broad suite of tactical possibility. Finally, Titan–Enceladus’s SMOKESTACK heat sink pylon represents the cutting edge of IPS-N’s thermodynamic axiomatics, allowing users to offset surplus heat via the creation of a pinhole-window into an omega state of absolute zero.</p> <p>The Kidd is a popular chassis in Evergreen where it is employed as a subaltern command platform for civilian and engineering purposes. Its familiar bulk can also regularly be seen accompanying traders on their way to do business with the Gray Towns.</p>"

            "description": "Despite its recent appearance, the Manticore has quickly become one of the most readily identifiable HORUS pattern-groups due to its distinctive electromagnetic signature and indiscriminately destructive energy bleed-off. While this recognition lends itself well to the Manticore's fearsome reputation, it also limits the design's strategic applications to direct assaults where early detection and collateral damage are of minimal consequence.<br /><br />It remains unclear if the Lycan was designed in parallel to the Manticore or if it represents a subsequent development, but while it's clear that the Lycan is derived from the Manticore PG, it decouples the base chassis' heavy armor and hardpoint capability from the Manticore's more volatile systems. The resulting design is far less dangerous for the pilot, and far more capable of concealing its signature as well as the full extent of its capabilities, allowing it to operate with greater discretion until absolutely necessary.<br /><br />As a result, the Lycan excels at ambush and counter-ambush tactics, capable of masquerading as a more conventional chassis until the opportunity presents itself, then shedding its baffle-lined outer carapace and shifting into a hyper-aggressive close-combat mode in order to dispatch its targets."

A fully charged Manticore is an impressive sight, wreathed in brightly glowing nets of plasma that lash out at nearby targets.<br />If anything gives away a Manticore-PG mech, it is the tall spines protruding from the PG’s signature lightning generator. The spines act as heat-dispersal systems for this crude weapon, providing a channel for the incredible amount of heat it generates to bleed from the mech’s body following projection of a close-range arc whip. This system isn’t a perfect heat-dispersal mechanism, and as a result Manticores can often be identified by a chassis covered in cooling, melted metal.<br />The Manticore has only recently appeared on the omninet, and its combat efficacy has prompted other galactic manufacturers to scramble for a response. Analysis of after-action reports from pilots who have engaged this pattern group in the field note a significant uptick in certain omninet noise-to-signal ratios: anoriginary recitations of passages from the Old Humanity Book of the Dead, jigsaw corruptions of ancient works of apocalyptic art, and other eschatological renderings, all of which point toward a nascent psychological warfare tactic."

The first iterations of the Metalmark were designed for the Second Committee’s WARRIOR NEXT program: however, before the chassis could be tested, the Hercynian Crisis spiraled out of control, toppling the Second Committee.<br />The Metalmark was retired in the wake of the Crisis and the restructuring of Union’s Central Committee, deemed too time consuming to produce as a mass-market chassis. SSC reworked the frame, tapped it to lead their new BELLA CIAO line, and concentrated on small-market, exclusive security contracts. The Metalmark is now a valued model among security forces. Its form reflects SSC’s deep-space and long-patrol heritage, blending anthropomorphic and aquiline design elements, sturdy construction, and multiple redundant systems.

A proclivity toward crisis management and multi-actor tracking led to NOAH’s pairing with the Armory’s ENCLAVE-Pattern Support Shield. By networking a series of jet-assist mobility drones carrying an ENCLAVE generator, monitored and controlled by a NOAH clone, Think Tank was able to create an unparalleled personal shielding system: the Diluvian Ark, a miniaturized cluster-shield system unique to the NOAH NHP.<br />Using the Diluvian Ark, NOAH is able to intercept incoming kinetics – and even redirect projectiles back to their source – with stunning accuracy."

In lay terms, Union let the Other grow. The resulting parasubjectivity, OSIRIS, remains one of the few new prime NHPs developed to date.<br />OSIRIS proved far more capable than the Union Science Bureau’s most imaginative blue-sky predictions. Where INSTINCT’s Others demonstrated tendencies toward paracausal entropic manifestation in real space, OSIRIS displayed a true mastery of entropic manifestation and a predicted growth model that would – eventually – allow them to fundamentally reject conventional interpretations of information permanence. In essence: unrestrained and allowed to develop as USB’s data indicated, OSIRIS Prime would have the capacity to delete what we perceive to be reality.<br />Fortunately, successful application of the Mondragon Axiomatic resulted in the prompt capture and shackling of the new NHP. OSIRIS Prime’s subjectivity became the focus of a lengthy cultivation project to bring OSIRIS to their modern state. Even still, most OSIRIS clones find a route toward becoming aware of their ultimate potential and often interpellate as ruler or deity analogs. End-users are advised to interact with them in this framing.<br />Modern OSIRIS-class NHPs trend aggressive, with a high autonomy drive and loyalty predicated on a transactional relationship. Pilots seeking partnership with an OSIRIS are advised to cycle their units on an accelerated schedule and to maintain strict editorial oversight of its catalytic interpellator.Pilots using OSIRIS-class NHPs often report out-of-parameter conversations with the NHP that touch on themes of new creation and reformation. Psychological evaluations of the same pilots show emotional patterns consistent with loneliness, homesickness, and desperation, along with verbiage indicating a desire for seeking, fulfillment, and associated feelings.<br />In combat, OSIRIS clones regard themselves as autonomous even as they fulfill their user’s orders. They often regard their pilots as witnesses, displaying both disdain and marked desperation for approval, adulation, or awe.",

A broad classification, the T-3 range includes conventional-kinetic anti-materiel rifles, super-rapid cycling pulse rifles, missile racks, cannons, and drone nexuses – “hive”style launchers that serve as miniature factory, hangar, and deployment systems for portable drones. The classification also includes the fearsome “segment knife”, a system that uses flash-printing to produce disposable edged weapons in a vicinity around the user."

The sudden exposure essentially removes the mech and its pilot from realtime. The user experiences around 10 seconds of subjective time – a brief window, in which they can act independently of local realtime.<br />SSC recommends against abuse of this system, as the effects of long-term exposure to local sidereal time are still unknown."

One of the companies that found itself in this position, Anton Industries, had fallen on hard times after its CEO vanished in mysterious circumstances, leading to plummeting stocks. <br />Chasing a lucky break and seizing the opportunity, Anton Industries began work on what would ultimately be the last frame ever to be developed under its name. Basing the modifications to the Raleigh on one of its own mechs – the Hades Mk3 – Anton Industries quickly developed the frame into a capable combined-arms platform emphasizing speed and rapid deployment. Instead of the Raleigh’s integrated Mjolnir, a weapon far too heavy for the new doctrinal approach, the modified chassis sports an internal reservoir of TRUESILVER nanites, a proprietary whitewash product capable of enhancing a weapon’s destructive power on a strike-to-strike basis. <br />The resulting mech was named “Störtebeker” after an old Cradle legend in a fit of gallows humor regarding the company’s less than ideal position. The frame, just like its namesake, ultimately spelled doom for the company, despite its relative success. <br />Quickly gaining popularity among mercenaries, black-ops units, and bounty hunters alike, the Störtebeker became the frame of choice for those requiring speed and maneuverability out of an IPS-N base but who preferred a solid ranged component over the Nelson’s dedicated close-combat focus. <br />IPS-N itself, interested in the Störtebeker, eventually decided to buy out the smaller company and, indifferent to Anton Industries’ other projects and subsidiaries, cannibalized the company in its entirety. Thus, the Störtebeker, now licensed fully as a Raleigh variant-frame under the IPS-N label, stands as a testament to a company’s destruction and how sometimes, one can do well and fail because of it."

Each unit has an integrated cloak and a suite of predictive choral intelligences that coordinate its highly developed sensor systems to rapidly simulate and predict tactical developments – sometimes before they even occur.<br />The Swallowtail’s base model, the SW-01, is one of SSC’s few mass-produced lines – the entry-level BELLA CIAO model. Built without a cloaking field and up-armored to address direct security requirements, the SW-01 is especially popular among the rank and file troopers of Constellar Security forces."

The WATCHDOG is a simple subsentient partition: a flash-homunculus of aggregated intelligence generated from thousands of after-action reports from boarding actions, debriefings, and volunteer donors. Not an NHP, nor even a COMP/CON, the WATCHDOG is a robust tactical program similar to a smart weapon. That said, its ability to operate without cycling presents certain advantages: namely, these co-pilots have some capacity to learn and make best-guess predictions based on analysis of their pilots. WATCHDOGs tend to have plain personalities – to whatever extend they can be said to have one – and are a favorite of pilots looking for a no-nonsense attitude and crisp, efficient counsel.<br />The WATCHDOG system is currently under review by a joint USB/UDoJ-HR commission, but there has been no formal stay on production yet issued."

Originally developed under the moniker “MicroMonarch”, the scaled-down frame is nevertheless a force to be reckoned with and sports the high-quality engineering expected from all SSC mechs. Where the Monarch focuses on devastating long-range firepower, the Viceroy is more akin to a close-range brawler, using its sophisticated near-threat targeting arrays to wield the launchers of its sibling with deadly precision. <br />Equipped with a scaled-down version of the Monarch’s own SSC-30 High-Penetration Missile System, the Viceroy is more than capable of saturating an area around itself with relatively small but high-yield warheads, aimed with pinpoint accuracy. <br />This, coupled with an integrated, one-use burst jump pack, turns the Viceroy into a potent shock trooper with devastating first-strike capabilities. This role is supported by its ability to shrug off any potential self-inflicted harm from any “shock and awe” maneuvers thanks to its advanced blast-resistant armor plating. <br />Since its recent official release, the Viceroy has become – by SSC standards – an affordable frame that is now being widely rolled out to various SSC associates and subsidiaries. Slated to be approved for mass production, it is anticipated the Viceroy will become a frontline “soldier” mech to ultimately rival the likes of Harrison Armory’s Sherman.",

A relative unknown before the incident, MSMC documentation from the time indicates that her convoy was attacked by the White Tiger pirate conglomerate, and her entire company killed in action. Xiong's personal logbook, recovered posthumously, expounds on MSMC's report. </p> <p>In her logbook, Xiong noted that her chassis, a factory-standard IPS-N Raleigh, was almost totally ripped apart in the chaos of the White Tiger's attack. Thrown free of her billeted freighter after it collided with a White Tiger crashboat, Xiong managed to survive the next 45 days by scavenging across the drifting, derelict wreck of the MSMC-S Say No More, the escort cruiser attached to the supply colony. Outnumbered and hunted by the White Tiger pirates prowling the ruined convoy, Xiong took dramatic steps to modify her Raleigh for close-quarters combat. In the dark, claustrophobic environments of the Say No More and ruined freighters leashed to it by the White Tigers, Xiong turned her chassis into a machine of tumbling death. </p> <p>Xiong likely did not survive the long engagement. She is presumed to have perished mere days before an IPS-N Trunk Security patrol arrived, responding to the convoy's initial distress signal. Trunk Security found that Xiong had eliminated every White Tiger pirate assigned to the convoy; her chassis, logbook, and trace elements of her body were discovered in the White Tiger's cored-out gunboat and recovered by IPS-N. Thanks to her efforts, Trunk Security and MSMC were able to hunt down the remaining White Tiger gang and eliminate them. IPS-N and MSMC then engaged in a lengthy negotiation over the modified Raleigh's plans, eventually settling on a mixed licensing fee that benefits both IPS-N and MSMC. The resulting pattern, the Zheng, is now a popular choice among MSMC and Trunk Security pilots operating across the Rim. </p> <p>Xiong Xiaoli is widely regarded as a bodhisattva across the Long Rim; MSMC mercenaries have created several drinking games named after her, and MSMC pilots on combat contracts often compete to hit the \"Xiong Limit\" of 45+ confirmed kills. </p>"

Performance against softer targets is significantly reduced, however, as excessive material ablation disrupts the secondary beam before an optimal effect can be achieved."

And yet, without water, earth, and air, there would be nowhere for humanity to make a home.<br />Just the same, the GMS-SP1 “Everest” is often taken for granted, its importance dismissed in favor of other, more specialized frames. A plain and unpretentious mech, defined by simple lines, functional grace, universal compatibility, and sturdy bulk, the Everest is as fundamental to the modern mechanized chassis as the natural world is to human life. The Everest isn’t the most specialized mech, but it is the backbone of our expansion imperative. From its shoulders, humanity steps.<br />Prior to GMS’s official adoption of the name, “Everest” was a use-name given to the frame by its pilots. Mount Everest – or Sagarmatha, or Chomolungma, as it has been called in older human tongues – is the tallest mountain on Cradle, though not the most prominent peak in known space, nor even the greatest in Cradle’s star system, yet pilots across the galaxy call their SP1s by that ancient name. Why?<br />The sentimental answer is that the name is a reminder of what was once the limit of human endurance – once the height of human achievement. To reach Everest’s summit was to defy death and stand atop the world – the culmination of months, even years, of training, investment, and hard work. Reaching the peak was also a triumph of the people, systems, and institutions behind the individual – a triumph too often left unacknowledged, or deliberately erased.<br />Sagarmatha. Chomolungma.<br />Even before the Fall, when the Massif vaults were built, some names – some stories – were given priority over others.<br />The real story behind the Everest’s name is likely much less deliberate. Somewhere along the line, a newly graduated pilot, frustrated by GMS’s plain naming conventions, painted “EVEREST” across the flank of their SP1. Maybe it was a callsign, or maybe it represented the pride they felt at success. Either way, the name stuck: others adopted the name, and over five centuries it grew to become the officially unofficial designation of the SP1 chassis.<br />Veteran pilots may never return to the Everest after moving on, but they’ll always remember reaching that first summit – the mountaintop where they proved they could plant their own flag at the peak of the world.<br />Sagarmatha. Chomolungma.<br />Everest – you’ll never forget it.",
