While chassis tend to be much more flexible and configurable strike platforms, tanks make up for this with the ability to more easily mount heavier armor without compromising their ability to employ large- caliber weaponry while on the move.

They see less use in cultures that have a preference for ranged combat, but there is a certain prestige accorded to pilots who adopt ancient weapons and survive to do it again.
