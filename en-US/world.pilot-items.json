Distinctly insectile in appearance, treatment allows the carapace to be molded into a variety of shapes and styles suitable for numerous occupational specialties ranging from long-range reconnaissance to heavy assault. While many examples of carapace armor are unpowered, ranger pilots and special forces units use carapace hardsuits created by marrying the plates to various strength-amplification exoskeletons and fitting them with upgraded power sources, interface systems, and environmental seals.</p><p>Acquiring a carapace hardsuit isn't a simple matter. Such suits don’t tend to be available for sale in currency or barter, instead being either handed down from pilot to pilot or custom-made according to a number of formal traditions. These traditions include seeking permission from a willing Egregorian donor to use their carapace and the personal participation of the wearer in the crafting, a process that can take weeks depending on the complexity of the suit. Should a PC manage to obtain one of these hardsuits, you may represent it with the following stats.</p>"

You feel complete.

An empath is someone who can not only register when Witness is being shared, but begin to understand it and, with some training, even add their own subjectivity to it.</p><p>Mere exposure to Hercynia is enough for a character to become an empath. Nobody is “born” an empath – it is a learned process, not an inherited one. Although, like all skills, some people find it easier than others, anyone can potentially learn to understand Witness. Normally, human empaths bond with Egregorians – there are many examples of such in the United Cities. Rarely, empaths can form bonds with other humans – a process that is as rare and wondrous to Egregorians as it is to the humans undergoing it, and one that also suggests that a human extension of Witness may latent and possible with exploration.</p>",

Distinctly insectile in appearance, treatment allows the carapace to be molded into a variety of shapes and styles suitable for numerous occupational specialties ranging from long-range reconnaissance to heavy assault. While many examples of carapace armor are unpowered, ranger pilots and special forces units use carapace hardsuits created by marrying the plates to various strength-amplification exoskeletons and fitting them with upgraded power sources, interface systems, and environmental seals.</p><p>Acquiring a carapace hardsuit isn't a simple matter. Such suits don’t tend to be available for sale in currency or barter, instead being either handed down from pilot to pilot or custom-made according to a number of formal traditions. These traditions include seeking permission from a willing Egregorian donor to use their carapace and the personal participation of the wearer in the crafting, a process that can take weeks depending on the complexity of the suit.

Such suits don’t tend to be available for sale in currency or barter, instead being either handed down from pilot to pilot or custom-made according to a number of formal traditions. These traditions include seeking permission from a willing Egregorian donor to use their carapace and the personal participation of the wearer in the crafting, a process that can take weeks depending on the complexity of the suit.

They are translucent, semi-liquid, and able to be stored when not in use, conforming to whatever container they are placed in. They clean the host’s body, aid natural healing processes, and eliminate waste. As desired, segments can become opaque, change color, or take on a new texture.

      "detail": "Get gossip, news, or hearsay from the streets. What you get depends on what ‘streets’ you are getting word from (high society, low society, hearsay, military chatter, etc). This probably takes a lot less time than investigating something in detail, but the information might be more qualitative or colored by opinion (sometimes that might be useful). You can always learn where the information came from or who to go to next."
