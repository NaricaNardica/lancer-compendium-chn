      "description": "絕大部份的人們不會去思考他們飲用的水、他們行走的大地，或是他們呼吸空氣的歷史。但是，沒有水、大地和空氣，人類就沒有地方能建立家園。<br><br>同樣地，人們已經把 GMS-SP1「埃佛勒斯」視作理所當然的存在，它的重要性早已被其他更加特化的骨架取代。這款機甲樸實無華，線條簡單，功能優美、具有全宇宙通用的兼容性以及堅固的外殼，埃佛勒斯對現代機械化骨架的重要性就和自然世界對人類的生存一樣。或許埃佛勒斯不是最突出的機甲，但它是我們擴張的基礎。站在它的肩膀上，人類文明才得以前行。<br><br>在 GMS 正式採用這個名字前，「埃佛勒斯」只是其駕駛員為這具骨架取的暱稱。埃佛勒斯峰——或是在比較古老的語言裡又被稱為薩加瑪塔峰或是珠穆朗瑪峰——是搖籃上最高的山，儘管不是已知世界中最高的山，甚至不是搖籃星系裡最大的山，但駕駛員仍繼續使用這古老的名字稱呼他們的 SP1。為甚麼呢？<br><br>比較多愁善感的答案是，因為這個名字讓人回想起人類曾經的耐力極限——以及人類成就的最高峰。登上埃佛勒斯峰意味著與死神對抗以及立足於世界最高點——也代表著數以月計，甚至年計的訓練、投資和努力的成果。登上埃佛勒斯峰同樣代表著登山者背後的人們、體制和組織的勝利，而這些功績通常太容易被忽略，甚至刻意被抹消遺忘。<br><br>薩加瑪塔。珠穆朗瑪。<br><br>即使在大崩壞前，當人們建造瑪西芙儲藏庫時，有些名字，有些故事，也比起其它事物更為優先。<br><br>埃佛勒斯這個名字背後真正的故事大概沒有考慮那麼多。也許只是在某時某地，某個新晉駕駛員對 GMS 的乏味命名系統不滿，因此在自己的 SP1 上寫下了「埃佛勒斯」這個名字。這也許是呼號，也許只是代表著那個人成功時的喜悅。無論如何，這名字在歷史上留下了足跡：其他人也開始使用這個名字，然後在之後的五個世紀裡，它成為了 SP1 機甲支架官方的非官方稱號。<br><br>資深的駕駛員也許永遠也不會再回到埃佛勒斯的駕駛艙中，但他們永遠會記得他們登上的第一個高峰——證明他們能在世界之巔插上自己旗幟的的峰頂。<br><br>薩加瑪塔。珠穆朗瑪。<br><br>埃佛勒斯——你永遠不會忘記它。",

Basing the modifications to the Raleigh on one of its own mechs – the Hades Mk3 – Anton Industries quickly developed the frame into a capable combined-arms platform emphasizing speed and rapid deployment. Instead of the Raleigh’s integrated Mjolnir, a weapon far too heavy for the new doctrinal approach, the modified chassis sports an internal reservoir of TRUESILVER nanites, a proprietary whitewash product capable of enhancing a weapon’s destructive power on a strike-to-strike basis. <br>The resulting mech was named “Störtebeker” after an old Cradle legend in a fit of gallows humor regarding the company’s less than ideal position. The frame, just like its namesake, ultimately spelled doom for the company, despite its relative success. <br>Quickly gaining popularity among mercenaries, black-ops units, and bounty hunters alike, the Störtebeker became the frame of choice for those requiring speed and maneuverability out of an IPS-N base but who preferred a solid ranged component over the Nelson’s dedicated close-combat focus. <br>IPS-N itself, interested in the Störtebeker, eventually decided to buy out the smaller company and, indifferent to Anton Industries’ other projects and subsidiaries, cannibalized the company in its entirety.

The original pattern for the frame was bought off a mining commune that had rigged their support drones in a slapdash but ingenious neural mesh that both hardened them against tech intrusion and increased their operational efficiency many times over. Urban legend was that the original builder of the rig had used his drone team to bury caches of black-market Volador tech in several wandering asteroids, and out of extreme paranoia made his systems almost impossible to crack. To this day Northstar Branch Robotics tries valiantly to squash down persistent rumors that clues to the location of the caches are hidden in the Kidd&rsquo;s code base.</p> <p>Designed to provide an aggressive, all-theater support solution to rugged field teams in hostile environments, the Kidd mounts a trio of powerful systems to ensure a broad operational envelope. The Jolly Roger semiautonomous personal orbital platform, bundled with every genuine-license Kidd platform establishes theater control in any open or near-surface environment. A squadron of bundled subalterns (along with an onboard maintenance suite) guarantees friendly support in any environment and provides a broad suite of tactical possibility. Finally, Titan&ndash;Enceladus&rsquo;s SMOKESTACK heat sink pylon represents the cutting edge of IPS-N&rsquo;s thermodynamic axiomatics, allowing users to offset surplus heat via the creation of a pinhole-window into an omega state of absolute zero.</p> <p>The Kidd is a popular chassis in Evergreen where it is employed as a subaltern command platform for civilian and engineering purposes. Its familiar bulk can also regularly be seen accompanying traders on their way to do business with the Gray Towns.</p>",

These schemata can be printed according to pilot specifications and applied to a fully custom physical scaffolding. Notably, the Balor pattern group is only stable on large platforms (Schedule 2 and up) that are able to provide the raw energy output it demands – preferably ones with multiple redundancies, in case of catastrophic systems failure.<br>The Balor PG was first encountered during the joint Albatross–DoJ/HR pursuit of the Maw – a Free Company turned decentralized hive-being — across Khayradin’s Blanca Desert after the end of the Sanjak Rebellion. It was there that the joint force encountered, engaged with, and ultimately defeated the Maw and its Balors – and there that Union’s CentComm hoped the nanowash outbreak could be contained. Of course, subsequent Balor outbreaks on Khayradin have proven this hope to be in vain, and the pattern group continues to terrorize Karrakin commanders throughout Baronic space.<br>In the field, the Balor’s neurosynced hellswarm and greywash nanites form an undulating shroud that can pour out of its chassis at a moment’s notice, swirling in maddening patterns to form both eschatologic defensive and offensive systems. A Balor in its most active state is held together more by undulating, flame-like masses of nanite swarms than any physical structure.

Where INSTINCT’s Others demonstrated tendencies toward paracausal entropic manifestation in real space, OSIRIS displayed a true mastery of entropic manifestation and a predicted growth model that would – eventually – allow them to fundamentally reject conventional interpretations of information permanence. In essence: unrestrained and allowed to develop as USB’s data indicated, OSIRIS Prime would have the capacity to delete what we perceive to be reality.<br>Fortunately, successful application of the Mondragon Axiomatic resulted in the prompt capture and shackling of the new NHP. OSIRIS Prime’s subjectivity became the focus of a lengthy cultivation project to bring OSIRIS to their modern state. Even still, most OSIRIS clones find a route toward becoming aware of their ultimate potential and often interpellate as ruler or deity analogs. End-users are advised to interact with them in this framing.<br>Modern OSIRIS-class NHPs trend aggressive, with a high autonomy drive and loyalty predicated on a transactional relationship. Pilots seeking partnership with an OSIRIS are advised to cycle their units on an accelerated schedule and to maintain strict editorial oversight of its catalytic interpellator.Pilots using OSIRIS-class NHPs often report out-of-parameter conversations with the NHP that touch on themes of new creation and reformation. Psychological evaluations of the same pilots show emotional patterns consistent with loneliness, homesickness, and desperation, along with verbiage indicating a desire for seeking, fulfillment, and associated feelings.<br>In combat, OSIRIS clones regard themselves as autonomous even as they fulfill their user’s orders.

The spines act as heat-dispersal systems for this crude weapon, providing a channel for the incredible amount of heat it generates to bleed from the mech’s body following projection of a close-range arc whip. This system isn’t a perfect heat-dispersal mechanism, and as a result Manticores can often be identified by a chassis covered in cooling, melted metal.<br>The Manticore has only recently appeared on the omninet, and its combat efficacy has prompted other galactic manufacturers to scramble for a response. Analysis of after-action reports from pilots who have engaged this pattern group in the field note a significant uptick in certain omninet noise-to-signal ratios: anoriginary recitations of passages from the Old Humanity Book of the Dead, jigsaw corruptions of ancient works of apocalyptic art, and other eschatological renderings, all of which point toward a nascent psychological warfare tactic.",

Disassembly by Union technicians has found that Minotaurs contain a huge quantity of interior systems, occupying more physical space than should be possible by several orders of magnitude.
